# Pratical_Work_II

The goal of this project is to create a personal website that showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, highlights my academic achievements, and reflects my progress in my degree program.

# Description of my work

How I carried out the work: 
The task required creating specific web pages, each with its own function:
- A main section (index.html), which overarching information about the website.
- A contact section (contact.html), which will include a user-friendly form to contact with you. This form is designed without any scripting    elements that would send or save the entered content.
- A net section (net.html), which will provide information (name and link) about partner pages, establishing links to their respective websites. 
- A topic section (topic.html), which will offer a comprehensive information on a chosen topic, whether related to practical work I or a subject of personal interest.
- A degree section (degree.html) will provide a detailed overview of my degree.
- An about me section (about.html), which will include a brief description about you inspired by units 2 and 3 (Module 1), a curriculum vitae, two images, and some links to social media accounts.

I divided the work by first creating the entire folder and file structure and then adding content to one HTML page at a time, along with the corresponding files (CSS and images).

The pages all share the same format, header (navbar) with links to other pages and footer with links to various social networks or other external links. the decision to create all the html files was made to make the work easier by already putting the references inside the pages without having to go back and modify the navbar every time. For this same reason I created a .css file (menu.css) that contained all the code related to the style of the header and footer.

Each HTML file is associated with a CSS file containing its specific styling, in an effort to improve understanding and clarify the relationships between the various files.

# Problems during the development
One of the problems I had during the work was the lack of organization, I started writing my html pages without having a clear idea of ​​the style to use and found myself having to rewrite on the.css file that I had already completed. This lack of organization has led to some pieces of code repeating in the various .css files. 

Another problem I encountered was that of time, at the beginning I used much more time than expected to write my web pages, in the end I found myself having to complete the work in a short time and this led to having all Inside the code there are much more general parts that are not immediately understandable unlike the code written at the beginning of the work.
