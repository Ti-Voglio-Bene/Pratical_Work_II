                <h2>WHAT IS BIG DATA?</h2>
                <p>
                    The term "Big Data" describes unusually large and complicated data sets that go beyond the ability of traditional processing techniques for data management and analysis. These data are characterized by the "three Vs":

                <div>
                    <h3>Volume</h3>
                    <p>Volume refers to the amount of data that is constantly being generated and collected.</p>
                </div>
                </div>

                        <h3>Velocity</h3>
                        <p>Velocity essentially measures how fast the data is coming in. Some data will arrive in real-time, whereas other data will come in fits and starts, sent to us in batches.</p>

                </div>

                        <h3>Variety</h3>
                        <p>Data are very diverse so they cannot all be processed in the same way. Data are not homogeneous as they come from different origins or sources, are of different types and have different formats.</p>

                <h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF BIG DATA</h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of Big Data lies in its potential to provide valuable information.
                    By extracting meaningful insights from vast data sets, Big Data can lead to:

                    <ul>
                        <li>better decision-making</li>
                        <li>innovation</li>
                        <li>better outcomes (in various domains)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>

                <h2>DATA QUALITY AND ACCURACY</h2>
                <h3>Worst risk</h3>
                <p>
                    Large datasets can be inaccurate and may include inconsistencies or errors which can lead to inexact analytics
                </p>
                <h3>How to avoid it</h3>
                <ul>
                   <li>Define data quality standards</li>
                   <li>Perform regular data cleansing and validation processes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div>
            <h2>
                    THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS 
                </h2>
                <div class="img-text">
                    <img src="../images/big-data.png">
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Define Problem</h3>
                            <p>
                                The first step in any data analysis process is to define your objective. That means coming up with a hypothesis and figuring how to test it.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Collect Data</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once you’ve established your objective, you’ll need to create a strategy for collecting and aggregating the appropriate data. A key part of this is determining which data you need. This might be quantitative (numeric) data, e.g. sales figures, or qualitative (descriptive) data, such as customer reviews.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Clean Data</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once the data is collected, the next step is to get it ready for analysis. This means cleaning, or ‘scrubbing’ it, and is crucial in making sure that you’re working with high-quality data. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Analyze Data</h3>
                            <p>
                                The type of data analysis largely depends on what your goal is. There are many techniques available. Univariate or bivariate analysis, time-series analysis, and regression analysis are just a few you might have heard of. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div>
                            <h3>Interpret Results</h3>
                            <p>
                                The final step in the data analysis process is to share this information. This is more complex than simply sharing raw results, it involves interpreting the results and presenting them in a way that is digestible for all audiences.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    
                   
                    </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking into the future, it is certain that Big Data will play a huge part in shaping the world that we live in. From the amount of data being generated with each passing day, so much more can be done with their potential to create new insights and, therefore, discoveries.
