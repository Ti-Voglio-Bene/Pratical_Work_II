                        "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both
                        academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
                        his engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
                        role of a computer engineer in today's society.<br><br>
                        The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
                        develop practical skills.<br><br>
                        The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.

                                Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
                                and ethical foundations.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
                                computer systems and applications.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
                        development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
                        to the course.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
                        basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
                        written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
                        project of the University.

                        The methodology followed in this course aims to facilitate student learning of the fundamental concepts and
                        techniques of the subject. It combines Face-to-face sessions (theoretical and practical) to encourage student
                        participation and foster interaction between students and between students and teachers, promoting collaborative
                        learning and self-learning abilities through problem-solving strategies and intervention methodologies.
                        <br><br>
                        Face-to-face sessions will be complemented by a significant amount of independent work by students, often carried
                        out in groups, to promote collaborative and cooperative learning.
                        <br><br>
                        Non-face-to-face activities, which can be individual or collective, will be supervised by the teacher during sessions
                        and practical works (individual or group), aimed at fostering autonomous and collaborative learning. These non-
                        face-to-face activities include individual study and work, which will help reinforce the concepts covered in lectures
                        and the application of those concepts in practical classes.
                        <br><br>
                        In some cases, students will be required to present the main findings of their study or work in class, facilitating
                        knowledge and experience exchange among students, promoting effective communication skills and synthesis
                        abilities.
                        <br><br>
                        An online learning platform called the Canvas will be used to facilitate access to materials, work planning, as well as
                        communication with the professor and other students. This platform offers different electronic resources to
                        complement students learning.
