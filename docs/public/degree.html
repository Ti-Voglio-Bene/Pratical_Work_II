                        aims to develop the ability to abstract problems and information through symbolic and mathematical representation. 
                        The course will complement the more theoretical and methodological aspects of mathematics with technical approaches 
                        that enable the resolution of exercises, making mathematics a tool for understanding and computation in various applied fields.

                    <p>
                        The course aims to provide students with the tools, models, and languages necessary for using, designing, 
                        and developing relational databases and applications 
                        for such databases. More specifically, the educational objectives are as follows:

Additionally, the principles of asymmetric cryptography are analyzed, introducing the most widely used asymmetric algorithm, i.e., RSA.<br>
                        Data protection during transmission is presented by analyzing protocols at various network levels: IPSec for network-level data protection, SSL for transport-level data protection, and Kerberos as an example of an application-level protocol. This structure equips students to identify the vulnerabilities of individual protocols, which is essential for designing a data protection system. The course also aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of access control systems, achieved by analyzing access control mechanisms in DBMS supported by the SQL standard.<br>

                    <h2>SEGURIDAD</h2>
                    <p>
                        Information Systems are an essential part of the daily management of organizations. The continuity of operations largely depends on these systems, which handle the information and consolidate the knowledge and expertise of companies. For this reason, the security of Information Systems is a critical component of any design, development, or maintenance activities. This serves as a guiding principle for ensuring the security of infrastructures and services associated with information processing and communication technologies.

                            <li>Address software security by emphasizing confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This involves not only addressing the risks of unintentional loss but also malicious and illegitimate actions, confidentiality aspects, and intellectual property rights.</li>
                            <li>Understand the technical, organizational, and legal implications of the attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in Information Systems Security. This is achieved through the presentation of specific cases that integrate technical knowledge with a comprehensive view of the origins of security incidents and the solutions proposed for them.</li>
                            <li>Approach Information Systems Security as a process whose technical and professional resources must be managed throughout the planning, design, development, implementation, and maintenance phases.</li>
